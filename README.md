# ACPI-Testing



## Project Overview
The Female (FEM) Labeller is a flutter based application which is a simple and user-friendly tool designed for gynecologists to label ultrasound frames efficiently. Its primary objective is to collect medically validated ultrasound data of the female reproductive system to develop AI models for detecting abnormalities. By automating the annotation process in real-time, the application saves time and generates a large, annotated dataset, facilitating the development of robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for abnormality classification in both routine and clinical settings.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK: Comes with Flutter
- Android Studio or Xcode: For running the app on an emulator or physical device
- Firebase account: For backend services

### Installation 
#### (run these commands in the terminal)
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/misahub2023/FEM-LABELLER.git
    ```
2. Update flutter and its dependencies: 
    ```bash
    flutter upgrade
    ``` 
3. Check whether flutter is ready for use: 
    ```bash
    flutter doctor
    ```
    Resolve any issues shown by flutter doctor before moving to next steps

4. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

### Google Sheets Setup
1. Create a project in Google Cloud and enable the Google Sheets API.
2. Download the JSON credentials file for a service account and replace the placeholders in the `credentials` field with your actual credentials in `lib/services/sheet.dart`.
3. Create a new Google Spreadsheet and share it with the service account email (client_email from the `credentials`).
4. Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL and replace the placeholder in `spreadsheetId` with your actual spreadsheet ID in `lib/services/sheet.dart`.

### Firebase Setup
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Add an Android app to your Firebase project. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app` directory. A sample of the json file is already in the directory.
3. Add an iOS app to your Firebase project. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and place it in the `ios/Runner` directory and also update `ios/firebase_app_id_file.json`. A sample of the both the files could be found in the mentioned directory.
4. Modify the `pubspec.yaml` file to include the necessary Firebase dependencies:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      firebase_core: latest_version
      firebase_auth: latest_version
      cloud_firestore: latest_version
    ```

### Running the App
1. Connect your device or start an emulator.
2. Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
